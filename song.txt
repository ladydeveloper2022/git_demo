You try to hold me down so I became a soldier
Built up all theses walls and now I'm climbing over
Those nasty bees are tempting me
Oh Lord! but I ain't going back

You take me for a fool (fool), that doesn't make me foolish
Told me I was wrong (wrong), passion made you ruthless
Manipulate, It's just too late
Oh lord! 'cause I ain't going back no more
Your fueling of the flames gonna show you what I'm made of

Breakin' every chain that you put on me
You thought I wouldn't change but I grew on you
'Cause I will never be what you wanted
This fire (this fire), this fire
Is keeping me alive

Hey Lorddd
